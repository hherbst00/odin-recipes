# odin-recipes

This is my first project on Odin testing out my HTML skills

I ended up learning a lot on this project. The first page was really hard to get into, but once I started one the rest got easier. I worked on creating boilerplates, lists, images, links, and headings within html.

All recipes were from an amazing site: tosimplyinspire.com.
